## Tools

* Design tools: Adobe XD, Sketch and Figma
* Bracket colorizer extension for VSCode

* Bootstrap
* Tailwind CSS

### Vanilla JavaScript

* Modern JS (ES6/7)
* Need to master these before using React/Vue/etc

### JavaScript

* Axios
* Webpack (JS module bundler)

### Front-End Frameworks

* React - Still the most popular | Fairly easy to learn
* Vue - Really gaining traction | Easiest to learn
* Angular - Used more in enterprise | Steep learning curve
* State management: Redux (with React), Vuex (Vue), NGRX (Angular), Apollo Client + React Context API

### Server-Side Rendering

> Allows for: Better SEO, File System Routing, Static Exporting, etc

* NEXT (React)
* NUXT (Vue)

### Static Site Generators

* Gatsby (React)
* Gridsome (Vue)

### Server-Side (Back-End) Frameworks

* Express
* Django and Flask
* ASP.NET MVC

### Databases

* PostgreSQL (Relational)
* MongoDB (NoSQL)
* Firebase (Smaller to Medium sized apps, also gives authentication, etc.) or AWS (or even Azure from MS?) (Cloud databases)
* Redis/SQLite (lightweight/cache databases) - SQLite good for prototyping relational DBs or really small applications

### General Backend

* GraphQL

### Deployment & DevOps

* NGINX and Apache
* App Hosting: Linode, Heroku, DigitalOcean (Cloud-based Linux containers)
* Docker and Vagrant
* Testing: Unit, functional, integration, etc
* Load balancing, monitoring, security, etc

### Serverless Architecture

* "Backend" or "Functions" as a service (FaaS)
* AWS Lambda & Netlify
* (Servers) Just runs when we need it/them to

### Mobile Development

* Flutter (Uses Dart (programming language))
* React Native

Also check out: Progressive Web Apps

### Other

* TypeScript (typed JS) ?
* Laravel (PHP Server-Side Framework like Express) ?
* C# / ASP.NET ??
* Frathers.js (NodeJS server-side framework, apparently good for chat apps)
* Wordpress and Drupal
* Headless CMSs
* Desktop Apps With Electron ?
* Web Assembly would be cool to play around with. Could be used for games in the browser (idle game in Web Assembly when?)
