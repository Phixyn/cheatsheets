# Phixyn's Personal Wiki

This is my personal wiki. It contains notes, links and cheatsheets for various topics.

This site was generated by [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). You can also view the Markdown files for this wiki on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Phixyn/mwiki).

## Motivation

I like to learn about many different topics and needed a place to organize my knowledge. This wiki doesn't contain extensive documentation or guides. It's just a place to store notes and links that I found useful and may refer to in the future.

Some pages may become stale or outdated over time, so pruning may take place.
