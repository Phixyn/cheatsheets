# MWiki - A Personal Wiki

This is my personal wiki. It contains notes, links and cheatsheets for various topics.

All content can be browsed inside the `content` folder. Alternatively, you can browse the wiki online at: [https://wiki.phixyn.com](https://wiki.phixyn.com/). The static site is generated by [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/), a Vue-powered static site generator.

## Motivation

I like to learn about many different topics and needed a place to organize my knowledge. This wiki doesn't contain extensive documentation or guides. It's just a place to store notes and links that I found useful and may refer to in the future.

Some pages may become stale or outdated over time, so pruning may take place.

## Serving

To serve the wiki locally with hot reload:

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into its directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run dev`

The wiki is served at `localhost:8080` by default.

## Building

To build the static site for external or local hosting:

1. Clone the repository
2. `cd` into its directory
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm run build`

The files are located inside `content/.vuepress/dist` by default.
