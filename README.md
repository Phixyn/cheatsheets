# mwiki - A personal wiki

This is my personal wiki. It contains notes, links and cheatsheets for various topics.

All content can be browsed inside the `content` folder. Alternatively, you can browse the wiki online at: [https://wiki.phixyn.com](https://wiki.phixyn.com/). The static site is generated by [Simiki](https://github.com/tankywoo/simiki).

## Motivation

I like to learn about many different topics and needed a place to organize my knowledge. This wiki doesn't contain extensive documentation or guides. It's just a place to store notes and links that I found useful and may refer to in the future.

Some pages may become stale or outdated over time, so pruning may take place.
